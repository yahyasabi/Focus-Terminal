Stop getting frustrated when you 'die' in-game—use that frustration to level up your real life!

Focus Terminal transforms your study and productivity tasks into a satisfying, personalized Life RPG experience. Instead of letting failure demotivate you, this app uses the same addictive algorithms found in games to drive you toward real-world success.

🎯 The Core Concept: Gamified Respawn
The entire system revolves around turning failure into an immediate opportunity for productivity.

The Trap: When you 'die' (fail a level, lose a match, etc.) in any game, your dopamine system is primed for the next attempt.

The Switch: Instead of hitting 'Re-Try', you are required to switch to the Focus Terminal app (ideally set up as an accessible widget).

The XP Grind: You must complete a pre-defined task (e.g., read a chapter, solve a few problems) to earn XP.

The Respawn: Accumulate enough XP, and you earn your 'Respawn' currency, allowing you to get back into your game!

✨ Features Designed for Motivation
XP & Leveling System: Complete real-world tasks to gain experience, level up your character, and unlock new features or 'skills' in the app.

Shop System: Use accumulated currency or XP to 'buy' rewards that motivate you in the real world (e.g., a new book, a break, a snack).

Pomodoro Tracker: Integrate focused study intervals to track your time effectively and reward consistency.

Proximity Productivity: (A Pro Tip baked into the system!) The app encourages you to set up your study materials (like books) in easy-to-reach locations to reduce mental friction and laziness.

💡 Why It Works
This system works because it directly hacks the human brain's natural response to failure and progress, turning the negative feelings of losing a game into the high-dose dopamine rush of accomplishing a real-life goal.
